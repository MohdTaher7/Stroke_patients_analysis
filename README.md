We have a dataset of stroke patients By using this dataset we have to do some analysis and At the end of analysis we will find some patterns happening in storke patients<br>
lets break analysis into some milestones,so we can easily track our code <br>

 ## MILESTONE-1 <br>
 Objectives-1<br>
 - Import a dataset from a CSV file to a Pandas dataframe
 - Develop some basic insights about the dataset

observations of objectives-1
 firstly we Imported libraries, load our dataset, and we had done some basic operations on dataset and got some observations <br>
 the dataset have total 5110 entries and 12 columns and data type are int64,float64,object and other details about data.<br>
 <br>
 Objectives-2<br>
* Handle missing values
* Correct data formatting

 Observations of objectives-2 <br>
In objective 2 we have handled missing values and 
Correct data formatting,bmi column has 201 null value appeared in the data frame; those missing values may hinder further analysis,So we replaced bmi value by mean. Then we checked data formatting and all columns are of correct data type.<br>
we finally obtained the cleansed data set with no missing values and with all data in its proper format.<br><br>

## MILESTONE-2 <br>
Data Visualization<br>
Data Encoding (Convert the data into 0's & 1's from for data modling)<br>

## MILESTONE-3 <br>
Building ML model<br>
